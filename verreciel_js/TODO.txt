Bugs since 16:

Other bugs:

  What happens at state = 12 if you delete the map, and all the keys?

-------

Foresight:

  Trigger size should double for mobile devices
  Sort triggers by "distance from touch" if possible, before iterating through them
  Make tea drinkable

-------

Compare side by side with Swift build
  game state: 16
  iOS game state: 16

Find a better method to draw lines
Run a JavaScript linter

-------

LOOK OUT: Never override a method with a different signature

Render every location panel
  Does it look good?

Console updates
  When selecting locations on the map, the radar should update the console if it's connected to the console
  Cargo doesn't update console when an item is removed from the hold
  etc.  

Rethink missions
  They should be accumulative, at least in part
  Keep Cargo connected to Console, why doncha

State recovery
  What are some states that cannot be returned to?

Walkthroughs, too
  Player rotate, click, predicate
  Game speed modification

  Mission walkthrough chapters
  Record walkthrough chapters
  Chapter to reach other areas

Should journey reset at launch, or persist as part of game state?

What should be interactive, when?

Maybe systems could slowly orbit their stars, and stars could orbit the center

Spacewalk
  Out the hatch, presumably
